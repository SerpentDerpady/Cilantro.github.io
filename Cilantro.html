 This site is totally and utterly dedicated to the most
	 magical herb in the world... Cilantro. </h3>
	 <p style="font-style:italic; font-size: 25"> Cilantro has been consumed
		 by humans for thousands of years.
	Cilantro is an annual herb from the family Apiaceae, which contains 3,700
	species including carrots, celery, and parsley.

	All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and dried seeds are
	 most commonly used in cooking.

	Often known in the United Kingdom as coriander, cilantro comes from the
	plant Coriandrum sativum.

	In the United States, the leaves of the plant are known as cilantro (the
	Spanish translation) and the seeds are called coriander. Cilantro is also
	commonly known as Chinese parsley.

	Cilantro has been a part of human cuisine for a long time. Dried traces of
	cilantro were found in a cave in Israel that dated to around 6,000 BC.
	Remnants have also been found in ancient Egypt, showing that its use was
	widespread even in ancient civilizations.

	Moving forward a few thousand years, cilantro was brought to the early
	British colonies in North America in 1670, making it one of the first spices
	to be cultivated by the early settlers. </p>
